<summary>Advanced Single Target Priority</summary>

**What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think about these as steps to follow in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first thing in the list that you are able to cast.

The way this section is written is very formulaic and has the same structure as the Action Priority List (APL) used in sims.

**Pre-Combat:**
1. !Heart of the Wild!
2. !Prowl!
3. !Rake! from stealth.

**Select which talents you have talented to filter the priority list:**

6. [*Incarnation] !102543|Incarnation! if it's ready.
7. [*~Incarnation] !Berserk! if it's ready.
8. [*Feral Frenzy] !Feral Frenzy! with 1 or no combo points. 2 is also acceptable during !102543|Incarn!/!Berserk!.

    - !Rip! is up. AND

# Talents:

This section is still a work in progress and will be updated before raid/m+ release, so check back before then.

# Consumables:

## Potions

[Tempered Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=430599/tempered-potion) for every situation

## Food

[Feast of the Midnight Masquerade](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222733/feast-of-the-midnight-masquerade) or [Feast of the Divine Day](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=445112/feast-of-the-divine-day)

## Phials

[Flask of Alchemical Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212283/flask-of-alchemical-chaos) for every situation

## Weapon Rune

[Ironclaw Whetstone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222503/ironclaw-whetstone) or [Algari Mana Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224107/algari-mana-oil). These have extremely similar value, though you should default to [Ironclaw Whetstone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222503/ironclaw-whetstone).

# Gearing:
 
## Stat Priority:

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.

## Gems and Enchants

Gems - 1x [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) or [Culminating Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite) and a mixture of the other gems based on your sims. I would generally recommend [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite), as the crit effect portion of [Culminating Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite) is incredibly weak.

Weapon - [Authority of the Depths](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223784/enchant-weapon-authority-of-the-depths) for raid, [Stonebound Artistry](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223765/enchant-weapon-stonebound-artistry) or [Stormrider's Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223762/enchant-weapon-stormriders-fury) for M+

Chest - [Crystalline Radiance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223692/enchant-chest-crystalline-radiance)

Cloak - [Chant of Winged Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223731/enchant-cloak-chant-of-winged-grace)

Legs - [Stormbound Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219911/stormbound-armor-kit)

Wrist - [Chant of Armored Avoidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223713/enchant-bracer-chant-of-armored-avoidance)

Boots - [Defender's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223656/enchant-boots-defenders-march) or [Scout's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223653/enchant-boots-scouts-march)

Ring -  You should always sim your own character to determine what enchant to use in this slot. They tend to be very close.

## Embellishments

Currently still awaiting tuning and for some embellishments to be fixed in game. This section will be updated closer to Raid release.

## Trinkets

Much like embellishments, this section will be updated closer to Raid/m+ release. In the meantime do Delves just in case blizzard makes on busted by accident.

# Miscellaneous:

## What is snapshotting?

Snapshotting is when a buff that is present when a bleed is applied is maintained over the duration of the bleed, as opposed to buffing dots while the buff is up. For instance, if you !Rake! a target, and then press !Tiger's Fury!, the !Rake! will not be buffed by !Tiger's Fury!. However, if you !Tiger's Fury! and then !Rake!, that !Rake! will be amplified by !Tiger's Fury! even after !Tiger's Fury! falls off.

Rake snapshots !Tiger's Fury! and Stealth (including !Sudden Ambush!, see: !Pouncing Strikes!)
Rip snapshots !Tiger's Fury! and !Bloodtalons!
Thrash snapshots !Tiger's Fury! and !Moment of Clarity!
Moonfire (Lunar Inspiration) snapshots !Tiger's Fury!

If you have a Weakaura that tracks snapshot strength, it works as follows:
Green/higher than 100: Reapplying the bleed now would make it stronger
Grey/100: Reapplying the bleed now would keep it the same strength
Red/lower than 100: Reapplying the bleed now would make it weaker

Generally you try to maintain the strongest bleeds you can as much as possible, and the rotation above reflects this.

## What does pandemic refer to?

Pandemic is a mechanic that most damage-over-time spells have. When you cast a damage-over-time spell such as Rake while it's already applied to the target, the dots duration gets extended by the amount of time remaining on the dot. This extension is capped to 30% of the dots duration. For example, lets say you have a dot that has a 10 second duration. If you recast this dot while it has 2 seconds left, its new duration is 12 seconds. If you recast it again while it has 8 seconds left, its new duration is 13 seconds, because 30% of 10 seconds is 3 seconds. Pandemic got its name from an old warlock passive with the same effect, before it became a baseline feature of damage-over-time spells.

## Macros

None of these macros are required by any means, just a few that can be useful for some people.

**Ursol's Vortex @cursor macro:**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Ursol's Vortex
```

**Trinket macro:**

If you are using an on-use trinket/weapon that should go along with your cooldowns, use the following macro: (/13 for top trinket slot, /14 for bottom trinket slot and /16 for weapon.)
```
#showtooltip
/use 13
/use 14
/use 16
/cast Berserk
```

**Entangling Roots macro:**

Casts Entangling Roots on a target you mouseover, otherwise casts on current target if no mouseover.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] [] Entangling Roots
```

**Focus Skull Bash:**

Casts Skull Bash at your focus target, or current target if there is no eligible enemy focus target. Remember to bind focus target in WoW keybind settings.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@focus, harm, nodead] [] skull bash
```

**Adaptive Swarm macro:**

Casts Swarm on your current target, or a friendly if you mouseover them. This can be applied to numerous abilities you cast on allies (Dispel, Rejuv/Regrowth, Innervate etc to save on keybinds), as seen in the Rebirth macro further below. 
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, nodead] [] Adaptive Swarm 
```

**Rebirth/Other Macro:**

Casts Rebirth when you mouseover a friendly, or otherwise Mark of the Wild. Customise these macros how you please. 
```

```
